# Camera-Calibration
<font size=5 color=BLACK>**Introduction**</font>  
This is a camera calibration program designed for the optical navigation system of spinal surgery robots. Spinal surgery robotic systems commonly employ endoscopic cameras to provide surgeons with a visual guide during procedures.  
However, these endoscopic cameras are susceptible to camera distortion, as image 1 illustrates, which can impact the accuracy and reliability of the visual information relayed to surgeons. Camera distortion in spinal surgery robotic systems often arises due to lens imperfections, non-uniformities in the optical system, or the bending and reflection of light within the endoscope. These distortions may manifest as radial or tangential distortions, leading to image artifacts such as stretching, compression, or skewing of visual elements.
